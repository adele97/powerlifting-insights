I am an equally-talented software developer and powerlifter. This is powerlifting in data.

I use the [open powerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org) database to put together the visualisations.
At the moment I use the IPF dataset as it's smaller and easier to work with. Just while I figure out wtf I am trying to do here, 
and if anybody else finds this stuff as interesting as I do.

If you have any questions, or have a visualisation you'd like to see feel free to [reach out](mailto:adele@adelecarpenter.com)

 All plots are built with love in Kotlin:

- Kotlin JVM for enriching and importing data into postgreSQL 
- [Kotlin notebooks](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-analysis-overview.html#notebooks), Kotlin [DataFrame](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-analysis-overview.html#kotlin-dataframe), and [Kandy](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-analysis-overview.html#kandy) for data wrangling, analysis and presentation
