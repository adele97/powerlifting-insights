I am an equally-talented software developer and powerlifter. This is powerlifting in data.

I use the [open powerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org) database to put together the visualisations.
At the moment I use the IPF dataset as it's smaller and easier to work with. Just while I figure out wtf I am trying to do here, 
and if anybody else finds this stuff as interesting as I do.

If you have any questions, or have a visualisation you'd like to see feel free to [reach out](mailto:adele@adelecarpenter.com)
