In recent years, it's been really great to see totals being pushed in all age divisions, especially in the juniors.
It really feels like there is a lot of young talent entering powerlifting, and consequentially pushing the sport to new heights. There are a number of
junior lifters currently holding World Open records!
So I thought it would be fun to put that feeling to the test. What is the distribution of powerlifters by age on a global scale?

For these charts, I used the IPF-affiliate data set of [open powerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org), and included all events,
for which the bulk are made up of Bench and SBD. All equipment types (namely Equipped and Raw) are also included.

Firstly, I wanted to know what the distribution of age groups participating in powerlifting meets, and to see if this has changed at all over the decades.

Visualising data is part art and part science as you want to tell something useful, but at the same time not overwhelm with too many details. So I hope I have got the mix right here.

In the last article we established that powerlifting participation is growing rapidly. So I wanted to take that noise out of the equation, and just look at the overall breakdown of participation by age group.

What we can see is that competing in powerlifting is largely a young person's game. Across the decades, approximately 50% of those participating in meets are 25 or younger (the range is 46% to 53%).
We also see that roughly 80% of competing powerlifters are 40 or younger. What is really cool to see though, if we look at the top of the chart, that about 4% of competing lifters today are over 60. In the 1990s that figure was a only 0.9%. I'd love to see that trend continue.

Let's drill down now into the latest data, and try get a feel for how powerlifting is currently growing. The limitation of the visualisation we just saw, is that given that the sport is growing overall, 
the growth of the larger group can obscure the growth of the smaller groups and make it appear that these smaller groups are not growing at all.
And this is not the case!

The chart below shows the annual average growth rate of powerlifting across the same age groups over the last 10 years. As we can see, for all age groups above 15 years, the sport is growing.
