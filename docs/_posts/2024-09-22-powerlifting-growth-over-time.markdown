It's absolutely no secret that participation the sport of powerlifting has grown over the last few decades. 
But I needed a nice easy visualisation to start off with, so here we are.

Let's start with the growth of powerlifting from the start of the [open powerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org) database.
Open Powerlifting is the most comprehensive powerlifting database in existence, and the team over there is doing amazing work.

The charts in this post use data from the IPF and affiliates only. Mostly because it's a smaller dataset and which is a bit easier (faster) for me to work with at this time.
